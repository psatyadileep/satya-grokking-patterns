LC704. Binary Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        L = 0
        R = len(nums) - 1

        while L <= R:
            mid = (L + R) // 2

            if target > nums[mid]:
                L = mid + 1
            elif target < nums[mid]:
                R = mid - 1

            else:
                return mid

        return -1
