LC143. Reorder List
ou are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]


 1- > 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
This is combination problem :
-> reverrse a linked list
-> find the middle-> merge two lisst

APporach :
-> find the middle of the list
-> reverse the element from middle to the end
-> merge the two lists
