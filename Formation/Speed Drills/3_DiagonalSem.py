Given a square matrix of integers, return the sum of the elements along the two major diagonals, top left to bottom right and top right to bottom left. Do not count the same index more than once.

Example:
Input:
[[1,2,3],
[4,5,6],
[7,8,9]]

Output: 25
Explanation: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25 (note that 5 is not counted twice).
